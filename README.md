# Overview

`pantracks` provides a convenient way to read particle tracking output on disk, particularly that generated by [`runtrackpy`](http://github.com/nkeim/runtrackpy/). Once in memory, tracks data are represented as [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) `DataFrame` objects. 

To see it in action, have a look at the examples for [`runtrackpy`](http://github.com/nkeim/runtrackpy/).

It is hoped that this model can be extended to other file formats in the future, including that described by [`sm_core`](https://github.com/tacaswell/sm_core/).

# Installation

The easy way:

    pip install 'git+http://github.com/nkeim/pantracks/#egg=pantracks'
